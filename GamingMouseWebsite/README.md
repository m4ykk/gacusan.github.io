# 🖱️ Gaming Mouse Website Project

This is a static website prototype for a fictional company, **AuraGear**, specializing in high-performance gaming mice.

## 🚀 Structure

The project follows a standard web development structure:

* `index.html` (Renamed to `home.html` for clarity) - The main landing page.
* `about.html` - Information about the company and its philosophy.
* `contact.html` - A form-based page for user inquiries.
* `product.html` - A sample page showcasing a specific mouse model.
* `style.css` - All styling rules (CSS).
* `script.js` - Simple JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation toggle).
* `README.md` - This file.

## ✨ Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
* **Modern Aesthetics:** Uses a dark theme suitable for a gaming brand, featuring vibrant accent colors.
* **Modular Navigation:** A consistent navigation bar across all pages.

## ⚙️ Setup

1.  Create a folder named `gaming-mouse-site`.
2.  Inside, create the seven files listed above.
3.  Copy and paste the corresponding code into each file.
4.  Open `home.html` in your web browser.

**Note:** For the design to look complete, you should manually add an `images` folder and include placeholder images (e.g., `mouse-hero.jpg`, `mouse-model.png`) as referenced in the HTML.
